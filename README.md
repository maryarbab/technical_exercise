1- Based on the EPA Excel file, make yourself familiar with file format.

2- Develop a python script to extract the emission factors from this Table into the EFDB-like structured normalized data format.

Use EmissionsFactorsDB.csv, DATA_GUIDANCE.md, Contributing guide, Sector-category-Id_structure.csv from this repo to guide your reformatting.

3- Usually after the script-based ingress, still some manual adjustments by the data team is needed.  After we are done with normalization for this year, we know that next year the EPA will release a new dataset. How would you automate the ingress of data to not repeat any manual adjustments done?
